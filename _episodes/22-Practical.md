### Set up a new project.
Create a new project and new script. Add a data folder to the project and place your dataset in a data folder.

### Consider the type of data in your dataset.

Understanding the data types in your dataset is crucial for effective processing and analysis.

Consider:
1. What kind of data am I dealing with?
2. What type/types is my data?
3. Have I seen an example that relates to my data?
4. What libaries will I need? 
5. What am I not sure about with my dataset?

### What import method will I use?

The method of importing data into Python depends on the data format and source. You may have a very common file type (e.g., CSV Files) or something much more unusual that may need an approach we have not covered.

### How am I going to store my data in Python?

Choosing the appropriate data structure for handling your dataset can greatly influence your workflow.

1. What functionality do I want?
2. How does my data type influence the way I am going to store it?
3. How will it influence run-time?

### When you start writting code

1. Start by writing notes \(\#\) detailing your workflow. 
2. Don't try and write everything in one go. Write and verify.
3. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

### Stretch tasks

1. Try visualising some interesting aspects of your data.
2. Collate some statistics about your dataset. 

### Recap & reflect

Consider the material we have covered today: 
* Are all concepts clear?
* Are there any other tools you feel you need?
* What section did you find the most difficult?
* What content may you need more support with?
* Am I clearer about the problem I am going to solve?
