questions:
- "What other data structures are there?"
- "Why are there other data structures?"
objectives:
- "Understand some of the uses for lists and dictionaries in Python."
- "Start thinking about why we need to store data in different structures"
keypoints:
- "Dictionaries: Efficient for fast key-based retrieval and storing data with unique identifiers."
- "Lists: Versatile collections for storing ordered heterogeneous data types with various operations like indexing and appending."
- "Different data structures solve different problems. You donâ€™t need to know every data structure and its advantages and disadvantages, but understanding this concept will help you know what questions to ask when you start storing your own data."

## Lists

- Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of any data type.
- They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.
- Lists are created using square brackets '\[ \]'.

Example of list creation:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Indexing and accessing elements:
- Elements in a list are accessed using square brackets '\[ \]' and indices (e.g., my_list\[4\]).
- Indexing starts from 0 for the first element.

```
last_element = my_list[-1]   # Accessing the last element
```
{: .language-python}


### Manipulating lists:
- Lists support various operations like adding, removing, and updating elements.

Examples of manipulation:
```
my_list.append('orange')     # Adds 'orange' to the end of the list
my_list.insert(2, 'pear')    # Inserts 'pear' at index 2
my_list.remove('banana')     # Removes the first occurrence of 'banana'
my_list.pop()                # Removes and returns the last element
my_list[0] = 'grape'         # Updates the first element to 'grape'
```
{: .language-python}

## Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- They are mutable and can contain keys of any immutable data type.
- Dictionaries are created using curly braces \{\}.

Example of dictionary creation:
```
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```
{: .language-python}

### Accessing elements:
- Elements in a dictionary are accessed using square brackets \[\] and keys.

Example of accessing elements:
```
person_name = my_dict['name']   # Accessing value corresponding to 'name' key
```
{: .language-python}

### Manipulating dictionaries:
- Dictionaries support various operations like adding, removing, and updating key-value pairs.

Examples of manipulation:
```
my_dict['gender'] = 'Male'     # Adds 'gender': 'Male' to the dictionary
del my_dict['age']             # Removes the key 'age' and its value
my_dict['city'] = 'Los Angeles' # Updates the value of 'city' key to 'Los Angeles'
```
{: .language-python}

## Overview

### When to Use Lists:

* **Keep Things in Order**: Use lists if you need to keep things in a specific order. For example, a list of values that you want to keep in the order you added them.
* **Access by Position**: Lists are great if you want to get items by their position, like getting the first, second, or third item.
* **Easy to Add/Go Through Items**: If you just need to add items to the end or iterate items one by one, lists are a good choice.

### When to Use Dictionaries:

* **Key-Value Pairs**: Use dictionaries if you need to match up pairs of information (e.g., names and phone numbers, or words and their meanings).
* **Quick Lookups**: Dictionaries are super fast at finding items if you know the key (e.g., looking up a phone number if you have the name).
* **Flexible Adding/Removing**: It's easy to add or remove items in dictionaries particularly with large amounts of data.

### In simple terms:

Lists are like an ordered group of things where you can easily get the item by its position.
Dictionaries are like a phone book where you can easily find a value if you have the key.
