## How do I load a project?

Download [this zip file](../fig/AISummerSchool.zip). Extract it to a sensible place. Go to Spyder and select **'projects'** > **'open projects'** and select the folder you just extracted.

{% include figure.html max-width="100%" file="/fig/project.png"

### What is this project?
