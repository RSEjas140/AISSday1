This is day one of the AI Summer School. It will include a condensed introduction to Python and Spyder. We have aimed to provide you with the basic information you will need to upload, manage, and manipulate your data before moving on to machine learning. It is a big task to learn a programming language, especially if you have no experience. You will not be fluent in Python by the end of this session, but hopefully, you will be off to a good start.

By the end of day 1, we hope you will be confident to:

* Navigate Spyder, install packages, and manage projects.
* Handle variables and data structures (arrays, lists, and data frames).
* Impliment flow control.
* Create functions.
* Plot simple graphics.

By the end of day 1, we hope you will have considered:
* The kind of data you have
* What you need to learn about your data
* What kind of problem you can solve
* What you may need additional help with

FAQ sessions: demonstrators/attendees email jas140@aber.ac.uk with any good/common/difficult questions and we will collate and answer.
